# CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) Matrix Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) matrix data structure in C++. CSR matrices are useful for efficiently representing and performing operations on sparse matrices, where most of the elements are zero.

## Files
- `csr.h`: Header file containing class declarations for the CSR matrix.
- `csr.cpp`: Implementation file for the CSR matrix class.
- `main.cpp`: Sample main file demonstrating the usage of the CSR matrix class.
- `Makefile`: Makefile to automate compilation and execution.
- `test.cpp`: Test file containing unit tests for the CSR matrix class.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile the program use the makefile.

## Usage
1. Include `csr.h` in your C++ code.
2. Create CSR matrix objects using the provided constructors and member functions.
3. Use member functions to perform operations on CSR matrices, such as compression, retrieval, and comparison.
4. Sample usage can be found in `main.cpp`.

## Testing
Unit tests for the CSR matrix class are provided in `mytest.cpp`. You can compile and run the tests using the Makefile:
